Sum of Digits - Divisible by K
The program must accept two integers N and K as the input. The program must print the count of integers from 1 to N having the sum of digits divisible by K.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the count of integers from 1 to N having the sum of digits divisible by K.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
30 4

Output:
6

Explanation:
Here N = 30 and K = 4.
There are 6 integers from 1 to 30 having the sum of digits divisible by 4.
4 8 13 17 22 26
So 6 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
100 10

Output:
9

Explanation:
Here N = 100 and K = 10.
There are 9 integers from 1 to 100 having the sum of digits divisible by 10.
19 28 37 46 55 64 73 82 91
So 9 is printed as the output.
